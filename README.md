# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

Overview of Project:

Client requested an analysis of campaign trends to determine how different campaigns progressed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. The provided 
data covered the years of 2014 to 2017. This data source includes campaign categories, goals, funding, and the outcome of each campaign. 

Analysis and Challenges:

After setting a few conditions on the data set to pull the information needed from source data, we created charts to reflect campaign trends. We used pre-existing   categories from the dataset for data categorization and organization. This was a prerequisite to charting the trends of this data. After a review of the dataset,   it was determined that the line chart best depicted these trends. Theater outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals depict the trends of this   data in line chart format. There it is easier to see the trend of successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarter campaigns. The main challenge of this project is     the within the limitations of the dataset. We are able to track the trends of these campaigns but not necessarily the causality of these results based on the       data. 

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Conclusions:

The most successful Kickstarter campaign month was May. June & July had relatively high number of successful Kickstart campaigns. The number of failed Kickstarter   campaigns ranged from 31-52 for each month throughout the year. 

Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion:

The number of successful and failed campaigns based on goals are mirror reflections. The factors that cause campaigns to succeed may be causally linked to           reducing the number of failed campaigns based on this trend. 

Dataset Limitations:

The numbers in the dataset show the end result and how it differs from the goal. This dataset does not show external factors that cause or influence whether a       campaign is successful or fails. 

Other Tables and/or Graphs:

Pie graph could be created to represent the percentage successful and failed. Histogram could also be used to show the outcomes based on goals trend.
